README, PA 8: Multitexturing

Time taken: ~7 hours

Runs fine on my two ATI card machines, but there's always a possibility of different errors on nvidia stuff

Controls:
	up/down arrow keys - move the ball forward and backwards.
	w/a/s/d - look around.
	space/x - jump/lower the ball.
	
Things to look for / at:
	
	-NOTE- the vast bulk of the time was spent on trying to create an automatic, three-dimensional unwrapping of terrain (triplanar texturing) provided by this link: http://developer.nvidia.com/node/158. I realized too late that it would take more time than I had to implement, however. 

	I use a bit of multitexturing to create an ambient effect in the shadows. The effect follows the countour of the west-sloping terrain, which is itself a texture.
